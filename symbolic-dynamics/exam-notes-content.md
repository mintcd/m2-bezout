## Shift Spaces
  
  1. [x] Metric and topology
  2. [x] Cylinders (fix some coordinates)
  3. [ ] Orbits
  4. [x] Shift space
  5. [x] Golden-mean shift 
  6. [x] Shift of finite type
  7. [x] Sofic shift
  8. [ ] Shift of finite type is sofic. 
  9. [ ] Factorial and extendable languages
  10. [ ] The language of a shift space is factorial and extendable and vice versa.
  11. [ ] Equalities for languages and shift space generated from $L$ and $X$.
  12. [ ] Irreducible shift spaces
  13. [ ] Uniformly recurrently shift spaces
  14. [ ] Trim automata
  15. [ ] Every sofic shift has a trim deterministic presentation.
  16. [ ] Every irreducible sofic shift has a unique minimal-state deterministic presentation.
  17. [ ] An irreducible shift $X$ is of finite type if and only if its minimal deterministic automaton is local.
  18. [ ] An irreducible deterministic automaton is local if and only if it has at most one cycle with a given label.
        
## Conjugacy

  19. [ ] Block maps (from blocks to letters) and sliding block codes (extend a block map for shift spaces).
  20. [ ] Morphisms between $(X,\sigma_X)$ and $(Y,\sigma_Y)$.
  21. [ ] Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem: every morphism is a sliding block code and vice versa.
  22. [ ] Every shift of finite-type is conjugate to an edge shift.
  23. [ ] State splitting (hard to remember)
  24. [ ] Higher block codes extend from the block maps (blocks to letters in $\mathcal{B}_k(X)$) with property $X^{(k)}$ is conjugate to $X$.
  25. [ ] Transition matrix $M$ has $M_{ij}$ the number of edges from $i$ to $j$. Composition matrix is its transpose.
  26. [ ] Irreducible matrix (there is a path from $i$ to $j$ for every $i,j$): $\forall i,j \exists n: M^n_{i,j} > 0$
  27. [ ] Primitive matrix: $\exists n \forall i,j : M^n_{i,j} > 0$ ($n$ is called the exponent of $M$)
  28. [ ] Perron-Frobenius theorem
  29. [ ] Topological entropy (invariant under conjugacy)
  30. [ ] Let $A$ be an irreducible deterministic automaton of an irreducible sofic shift $X$ and $M$ its adjacency matrix. Then $h(X) = \log\lambda_M$.
  31. [ ] Periodic points and zeta function and relation with adjacency matrix.


## Substitutions
  31. [ ] Composition matrix: $M_{b,a} = |\sigma(a)|_b$
  32. [ ] $L(\sigma)$ and $X(\sigma)$
  33. [ ] Growing words
  34. [ ] If $a\in A$ is growing, then for every $r$, the word $\sigma^{r\cdot|A|}$ contains at least $r+1$ non-erasable letters.
  35. [ ] Primitive: one can generate every $b$ from every $a$. Every letter is growing and $\mathcal{L}(\sigma) = \mathcal{B}(X(\sigma))$.
  36. [ ] $\mathcal{L}(\sigma) = \mathcal{B}(X(\sigma))$ iff $\L(\sigma)$ is extendable.
  37. [ ] Return words
  38. [ ] A shift space is minimal if and only if it is uniformly recurrent.
  39. [ ] Primitive substitution shifts are minimal
  40. [ ] A shift space $X$ is uniformly recurrent if and only if it is irreducible, and for every $u\in \mathcal{B}(X)$ the set of return words to $u$ is finite.
  41. [ ] Linear recurrence
  42. [ ] Primitive substitution shifts are linearly recurrent
  43. [ ] A minimal substitution shift is linearly recurrent.

## Realizability and Representability

  44. [ ] $\sigma$-representation (substitute $x$, then shift $k$). Centered representation: shift less than $|\sigma(x_0)|$
  45. [ ] Recognizable: at most one centered representation.
  46. [ ] For endomorphism, every $y$ has a representation.
  47. [ ] Elementary substitutions: mapping to a non-smaller alphabet (not loose information).
  48. [ ] If $\mathrm{rank} M(\sigma) = |A|$, then $\sigma$ is elementary.
  49. [ ] Elementary substitution are injective when expanded to $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$
  50. [ ] Recognizable for periodic points: every periodic point is recognizable
