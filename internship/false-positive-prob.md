Let $b$ be the number of bits in the character representation. Suppose that all representations are used i.e. there are $2^b$ characters in the character set $\Sigma$. Let $b'> b$ be the number of bits in the super-character representation.

Consider a bucket having patterns $P_1,\cdots, P_n$ sampled uniformly from $\Sigma^\ell$ and a text $T$ sampled uniformly from $\Sigma^L$. What is the probability of $T$ having a false positive in the bucket?
